# This mini project is using Python to analyze patients' datasets.
After necessary steps of data analysis have done, logistic regression model was implemented to predict the survival rate of these patients.
Do note that, due to running time took long time in parameter tuning, hence the tuning process was used some simple parameters, it still can be improved.

2 datasets (train and test sets) were included in this project, train set was given target variable (survived_1_year) whereas test set was not given because we would try to avoid ML model learn from the test set.
